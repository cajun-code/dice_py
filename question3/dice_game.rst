The Dice Game
==============

The Dice game is a two player game where each player takes turns rolling a pair
of dice.  The computer plays with a set of loaded dice that it uses every other
turn.  The Computer picks a random number and sets that to the dice. This
guarantees that the dice will come up double. Other than the loaded dice all
players are evaluated on the same rules of engagement. The rules are as follows:
1. The game is divided into "rounds."  During each round, each player gets one
"turn."
2. On a turn the player rolls two six-sided dice.
3. The player wins the round that gets a double (or higher double if both get
doubles). If neither player gets a double then the higher total wins.  If they
both have the same total then the player with the highest number on a die wins.
If they both rolled the same numbers on their dice then the round is a draw and
neither player gets a point.
4. On the next round the two players switch turns, i.e. the second one to roll
becomes the first one to roll and vice versa.
5. The rounds continue until the human player decides to quit.
